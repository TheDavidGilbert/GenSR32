Generic Staff Roster                     Readme Text File, Version 3.00
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
General Purpose of GSR

GSR  was  designed  to aid in the development  of  weekly staff rosters
for small business owners/managers. 

GSR can produce several types of reports to:
- locate any potential problems or conflicts within your rosters
- list hours allocated to each staff member and the associated costs
- produce total weekly costs and hours allocated for each roster
- detail staff availability for each roster by day of the week
- graphically display costs, hours and cost/hour figures for each day
  of the week broken down for each roster *NEW*
- print weekly rosters and staff timesheets
- print general and detailed staff lists

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Requirements

GSR requires Windows 3.1 or higher, mouse and a graphics capable 
printer. Installation requires approximately 7.5mb free disk space. GSR
will operate under 16 colour displays.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation

Unzip the GSR3031.ZIP (PkZip format archive) file to a temporary 
directory on your  hard drive.  From within  Windows, double-click 
'setup.exe'  from your file manager (or Windows Explorer for Windows 95
users).  Follow the prompts to install GSR to your hard drive (the
default installation directory is C:\GSR).

You may need to close down other programs which are running before you 
commence the installation process. Programs such as the Microsoft 
Office toolbar may conflict with the installation program and will need
to be disabled or unloaded.

PLEASE NOTE:  The installation process will overwrite your existing GSR
database.  If you have a previously installed version of GSR (Version 3
or higher) and you wish to retain your staff and roster details, copy
the GSR.DAT file in your GSR directory to a temporary location and copy
it back after installation has been completed.  Database files from
previous versions of GSR (2.0x or lower) ARE NOT compatible with this
version of GSR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started

GSR comes with a few pre-defined staff members and rosters for you to
experiment with.

View the 'Getting Started' section in the GSR help file for more
information on using GSR and building your rosters (select 'Getting 
Started' from the 'Help' menu).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

GSR and the concept of Shareware

GSR  is shareware. That means that you can download, use and completely
free test the program for a certain period (normally  30-45  days). You
may  also  freely  copy  and distribute  GSR  to others as long as the 
files  in  the original GSR3031.ZIP archive are not tampered with and 
no fee  is  charged. If you find the program useful and you continue to
use it, you are obligated to register.

The  whole  shareware concept is based on honesty. The registration fee
you pay allows me to support and continue to develop GSR in the future.

When  you  register  GSR you will  get  the  most  recent registered 
version of the program, email support and the registered version help
file along with constant updates about further developments in GSR 
and free upgrades.
